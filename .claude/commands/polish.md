# Polish a Draft

Research, proofread, and refine the draft: $ARGUMENTS

## Instructions

### Step 1: Read the Draft
- Load the draft from `src/content/drafts/<slug>.mdx`
- Identify gaps, placeholder sections, and research questions

### Step 2: Research
- Use web search to find supporting data, statistics, examples, and expert opinions
- Look for recent developments (2024-2025) relevant to the topic
- Find concrete case studies or real-world examples
- Note any counterarguments worth addressing

### Step 3: Style Consistency Check
Read 2-3 recent posts from `src/content/posts/` to ensure consistency with:
- **Tone**: Conversational, direct, engaging but not flippant
- **Structure**: Short paragraphs (1-3 sentences), clear section headers
- **Rhetorical devices**: Questions to engage, bold for emphasis, analogies
- **Opening**: Hook that poses a question or challenges assumptions
- **Closing**: Actionable insight or thought-provoking conclusion
- **Length**: Typically 800-1500 words

### Step 4: Refine the Content
- Fill in placeholder sections with researched content
- Strengthen the opening hook
- Add concrete examples and data points
- Ensure logical flow between sections
- Remove redundancy and tighten prose
- Add a compelling conclusion

### Step 5: Proofread
- Check grammar and spelling
- Verify all facts and statistics are accurate
- Ensure consistent formatting
- Check that headers follow a logical hierarchy

### Step 6: Summary
After polishing, provide:
- Key changes made
- Research sources used
- Any remaining questions or alternatives to discuss
- Confirmation the draft is ready for `/publish <slug>` or needs more work
