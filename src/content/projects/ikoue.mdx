This initiative is deeply personal and meaningful to me. The word IKOUĒ means "together" in my native language, embodying the collaborative spirit at its core.

I've carried this vision for years before finally bringing it to life in 2024. This non-profit organization aims to create better conditions for the Diaspora to support education, innovation, and sustainable growth in the Central African Republic.
