          In the tech world, there are job descriptions that often end with <em
            >Architect</em
          > like <em>Software Architect</em>, <em>Enterprise Architect</em>, <em
            >Data Architect</em
          >, etc. Just like the <em>Architect</em> of a building, these professionals
          are responsible for the design of the system: ensuring the house will not
          collapse at the first rain.

          Solutions Architects focus on designing complete solutions to business
          problems, which often involves multiple systems, applications, and
          technologies. They determine how different software components,
          hardware infrastructure, and business processes will work together to
          meet business requirements.

                When I'm not working on a client project or chasing the next
                startup idea, I'm usually exploring the world or the streets of
                Lisbon with my camera.

              <p>
                I'm absolutely not a professional photographer, but I love to
                capture the world around me.
              </p>
              <p>I mostly shoot with a Leica and Sony Alpha.</p>

              <p>
                I fell in love with cycling during the pandemic (go figure why).
              </p>
              <p>I really wish I'd started sooner.</p>
              <p>
                Before that, I wasn't into exercise at all beyond walking, but
                now cycling is an important part of my life. It's changed my
                mindset, my body, and given me new goals. My next big challenge
                is to ride beyond 200km. Every ride is a step closer to that
                goal.
